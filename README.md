# Deckimport -- Flashcard Deck Importer

One-off tool for pushing flashcard decks to a shared DB (probably Gun.db)

Next we'll create a small Vue-based UI for managing and editing cards

## to use

* clone repository
* ```npm install -g``` to add deckimport command globally
* cd to a deck folder (should contain audio and deck.json)
* type import command: ```deckimport```
* audio files will be added to IPFS and pinned locally
* cards will be added to Gun.db
* table of all cards will be output to disk for review
# deckimport
